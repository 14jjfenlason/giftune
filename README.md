NAME: GifTune

## TECH~~~~~
SWIPPER
Tailwind CSS Framework
HTML 5
CSS 3
Javascript
JSON for localStorage


## API~~~~~
-Shazam (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam)

## DESCRIPTION~~~~~

when the user types in the name of a song the song name appears as well as a GIF image closely related to it
if they search by band name, still come up with a gif image closely related. The music should "syncronize" with the song and more importantly the song title.
Then the gif image will appear and the song can be *played/stop/pause* with information showing related to the band, genre, year album released,picture of the band(inside information div). 
Also a "quick search" will be added for old song, genre, or bands that were searched and stored to local Storage.

AND/MAYBE**** song plays? (if we can get that to happen)
